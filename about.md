This site is dedicated to the art and craft of software development including the exact science of software engineering. Most of the practical tips and pointers revolve around issues related to building deterministic programs. Illustrations mostly revolve around using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework in the attempt to program with purity.


Built using [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/) with a lot of help from [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress/blob/master/README.md).
