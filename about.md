This site is dedicated to art and craft of software development. In addition, let's not neglect the exact science of software engineering. Most of the practical tips and pointers will revolve around issues related to building deterministic programs using Ruby and Ruby on Rails framework.


Built using [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/) with a lot of help from [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress/blob/master/README.md).
