    <title>Putting Soft Back Into Software</title>
    <description>Discussion about software development and software engineering. Practical points and tips illustrating how to bring &#39;soft&#39; back into software.  Also, exploring the possibilities of writing deterministic programs using Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

        <title>Software Development or Software Engineering?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to building and delivering software, things seem somehow different from the way they appear in other, non-virtual activities. For example, in the construction business we may have developers and engineers, however developers are focused on managing the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; of building and delivering, while engineers are focused on ensuring the &lt;em&gt;product quality&lt;/em&gt; by adhering to engineering principles. In software, on the other hand, engineers seem focused on managing the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; of software delivery, while developers tend to narrow their attention down to ensuring the &lt;em&gt;product quality&lt;/em&gt; by adhering to the principles of solid programming practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perception may be skewed, or even deceptive, but whichever the case may be, we need to understand the differences between software development and software engineering. So, in my view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software development:&lt;/strong&gt; the art and craft of producing computer programs that are deterministic by the virtue of their purity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
