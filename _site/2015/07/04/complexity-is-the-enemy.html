    <p>The reason why any software product tends to quickly harden into a surface that resembles hardware is very simple – it all boils down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity">complexity</a>. Complexity is the symptom of sloppy thinking. It was Mark Twain who once sent a letter to a friend apologizing for the excessive length – he claimed he didn’t have enough time to write a shorter letter. Seems counter-intuitive at first (doesn’t it require more time to write a very long letter than it would take to write a shorter one?), but Twain’s statement is absolutely true. It is very easy to scribble pages upon pages of run-on sentences. It gets really hard to write a letter that is short and to the point and that conveys the message clearly.</p>

<p>The same holds true for software. When writing software code, it gets real easy to churn thousands upon thousands on lines of sloppy, poorly thought out code. Being verbose is easy, being succinct and simple is hard.</p>
